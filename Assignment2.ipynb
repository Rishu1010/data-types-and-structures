Immutable data structures like tuples are inherently thread-safe because they cannot be changed.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - Strings are immutable in Python, which means that once a string object is created, its contents cannot be changed. When you perform an operation that appears to modify a string, Python actually creates a new string object with the desired changes, and the variable is then updated to refer to this new object. The original string object remains unchanged in memory until it's no longer referenced and is eventually garbage collected.\n",
        "   #reasons for this design choice:\n",
        "   *Performance Optimization: Immutability allows for certain performance optimizations. For example, Python can safely share the underlying data of identical strings in memory, which saves space.\n",
        "    *Thread Safety: In a multi-threaded environment, immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because they cannot be modified concurrently by multiple threads, eliminating the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.\n",
        "   *Hashability: Immutable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets because their hash value is constant. If strings were mutable, their hash value could change, which would break the lookup mechanism in dictionaries and sets.\n",
